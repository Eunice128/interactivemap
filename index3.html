<h1> Fast Food Restaurants vs. Healthy Food Restaurants </h1>

<h3> Bedford Stuyvesant is much different today from what it once was back when films like Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing highlighted the neighborhood. The area’s reputation is known for having a plethora of food options from all over like Jamaican, Trinidadian, Mexican, and Chinese. In the midst of gentrification, juice bars are opening up all over the Central Brooklyn neighborhood.  </h3>
